### ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Victor Navarro

When I was a child I wanted to be an inventor and this is the closest I've ever been.

- Love clean software and building apps from smart ideas.
- My coworkers call me *Vimtor* since I use [Vim](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164-ideavim) all the time. I take that with pride ðŸ’…
- Currently working full-time at [Bloobrids](https://www.bloobirds.com/) and freelancing on my own.
